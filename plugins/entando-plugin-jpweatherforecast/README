Weather forecast

The jpweatherforecast plugin adds a widget to the portal which displays weather
forecast. When the widget Weather forecast is placed in a frame the system will
ask for the name of the city and the country.
It is also possible to insert the geographical coordinates manually to pinpoint
location of a given point.

Latitude and longitude are returned by a third part service, namely GeoNames
(http://www.geonames.org/) which offers this service for free upon registration.
Before using the plugin an account at GeoNames must be created and the related
username must be inserted in the plugin configuration page which is placed in the
general settings page.
