**RSS App**

**Code**: ```jprss```

**Description**

The ```jprss``` plugin allows to serve the portal contents through RSS channels.

This plugin offers:

	•	An back-end interface used by the administrator to create and manage the contents served through RSS channel. 
	This interface adheres strictly to the pre-existing back-end graphics and settings.
	
	•	The RSS Channels Widget for the front-end designed to serve the list of the links of the active channels. 
	The link to RSS contents served in the front-end follows this pattern: 
	(http://ipaddress:8080/myportal/do/jprss/Rss/Feed/show.action?id) where  ```ipaddress```  is the  ```ip```  of the myPortal portal and the  ```id```  is the ID of the served content.
